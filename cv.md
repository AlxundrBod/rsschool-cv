## Information about me


I started my career as electrician and in less than a year I became an engineer of the second grade. One year after that i became  a first grade engineer and another year later i had a status of lead engineer. 
After, when it was time to move on, I started to learn a new profession, and in a short time i became the head of the purchasing department.
Now is the time to start a new chapter of my life and I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will allow me to become qualified Frontend Developer.
